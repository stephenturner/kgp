## Installation

``` r
install.packages("kgp")

You can install the development version of kgp from

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r

## basic example code
```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
